"""
Piston position estimation.

Calculates an estimated piston position depth trace from weight-stand
and release-device depth series, scope, and core length.

All internal calculations are in **meters**.  The scope and core_length
parameters stored in CSV metadata are in **feet**; they are converted
here using the constant ``FT_TO_M = 1 / 3.28``.

The detection algorithm mirrors the reference implementation:

1. **Before trip_time** the piston position is always computed from the
   weight-stand sensor.
2. **After trip_time** it continues using the weight-stand formula
   *until* ``abs(release - weight_stand) > scope``.  At that point
   (``start_core``) it switches to the release-based formula.

    Detection begins at *trip_idx* (the known trip event).  ``start_core``

    always tracks the weight stand, and only after the trip do we look for
    the release separation that signals the start of coring.
